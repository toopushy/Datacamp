There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.","metadata":{},"id":"fe0ea788-58dd-459e-8976-fafdb5c05c6d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n#print(schools.info())\n\n# Start coding here...\n#best_math_schools = schools[[\"school_name\", \"average_math\"]].set_index('average_math').sort_index(ascending=False)\n# No need to reorder columns since 'average_math' is already the index\n\nbest_math_schools = schools[schools[\"average_math\"]>640]\nbest_math_schools = best_math_schools[[\"school_name\", 'average_math']].sort_values('average_math', ascending=False)\n\n#print(best_math_schools.head())\n\nschools['total_SAT'] = schools['average_math'] + schools['average_reading'] + schools['average_writing']\ntop_10_schools = schools[['school_name', 'total_SAT']].sort_values('total_SAT', ascending=False).head(10)\nprint(top_10_schools.head())\n\nboroughs = schools.groupby('borough')['total_SAT'].agg(['count','mean', 'std'])\nboroughs['std'] = boroughs['std'].round(2)\n\nlargest_std_dev = boroughs[boroughs['std'] == boroughs['std'].max()].round(2)\n\nlargest_std_dev = largest_std_dev.rename(columns={'count':'num_schools', 'mean':'average_SAT', 'std':'std_SAT'})\n\n#print(largest_std_dev.info())\n#print(largest_std_dev.head())\n#print(largest_std_dev)\n# Add as many cells as you like...","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6","executionTime":27,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nschools.head()\n#print(schools.info())\n\n# Start coding here...\n#best_math_schools = schools[[\"school_name\", \"average_math\"]].set_index('average_math').sort_index(ascending=False)\n# No need to reorder columns since 'average_math' is already the index\n\nbest_math_schools = schools[schools[\"average_math\"]>640]\nbest_math_schools = best_math_schools[[\"school_name\", 'average_math']].sort_values('average_math', ascending=False)\n\n#print(best_math_schools.head())\n\nschools['total_SAT'] = schools['average_math'] + schools['average_reading'] + schools['average_writing']\ntop_10_schools = schools[['school_name', 'total_SAT']].sort_values('total_SAT', ascending=False).head(10)\nprint(top_10_schools.head())\n\nboroughs = schools.groupby('borough')['total_SAT'].agg(['count','mean', 'std'])\nboroughs['std'] = boroughs['std'].round(2)\n\nlargest_std_dev = boroughs[boroughs['std'] == boroughs['std'].max()].round(2)\n\nlargest_std_dev = largest_std_dev.rename(columns={'count':'num_schools', 'mean':'average_SAT', 'std':'std_SAT'})\n\n#print(largest_std_dev.info())\n#print(largest_std_dev.head())\n#print(largest_std_dev)\n# Add as many cells as you like...","executionCancelledAt":null,"lastExecutedAt":1739940906145,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":143,"type":"stream"}},"visualizeDataframe":false,"chartConfig":{"bar":{"hasRoundedCorners":true,"stacked":false},"type":"bar","version":"v1"},"lastExecutedByKernel":"c7f42625-f10b-4e1c-9819-baf26aaa96c8","collapsed":false,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false,"source_hidden":false}},"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","cell_type":"code","execution_count":28,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"                                           school_name  total_SAT\n88                              Stuyvesant High School       2144\n170                       Bronx High School of Science       2041\n93                 Staten Island Technical High School       2041\n174  High School of American Studies at Lehman College       2013\n333                        Townsend Harris High School       1981\n"}]}],"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.8.10","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3 (ipykernel)","language":"python","name":"python3"},"editor":"DataLab"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
